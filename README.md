In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

**Objectives:**

- List popular languages for Data Science.
- Describe commonly used libraries in Data Science.
- Demonstrate basic arithmetic operations in Python.
- Convert minutes to hours in Python.
- Provide examples of Data Science tools and their uses.
  
# Some of popular languages that data science use are

1. Python
2. R
3. SQL
4. Julia
5. SAS

# Some of commonly used libraries used by data scientists include:

* NumPy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* TensorFlow
* Matplotlib

## Data Science Tools


Jupyter Notebook   
Apache Zeppelin    
RStudio        

### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

Here are some common arithmetic expressions and their evaluations in Python:

**Addition:**
```python
result = 5 + 3
# This is a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers.
result = 10 - 4
print(result)  # Output: 6
result = 7 * 6
print(result)  # Output: 42
result = 20 / 4
print(result)  # Output: 5.0
result = 2 ** 3
print(result)  # Output: 8
result = 17 % 3
print(result)  # Output: 2

### Converting Minutes to Hours

Below is a Python code example that converts 200 minutes to hours:

```python
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
print(hours)
